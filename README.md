# 🌍 COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Aim
The aim of this project is to **analyze COVID-19 vaccination data** in detail, focusing on:
- Daily vaccinations  
- Fully vaccinated individuals  
- Total vaccinations by year and country  

## 🧠 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical role of the healthcare sector. Vaccination emerged as the most effective weapon against the virus. This project provides a deep dive into global COVID-19 vaccination data to extract meaningful insights that can inform policy and public health decisions.

## ❓ Problem Statement
This project helps answer important questions like:
- How many people are fully vaccinated?
- What is the total number of vaccinations by day, year, and country?
- What is the vaccination rate per hundred individuals?
- What are the daily vaccination trends by country?
- Which are the top 10 countries in:
  - Fully vaccinated population
  - Daily vaccinations
  - Overall vaccinations

## 🛠 Methodology

### 🔹 Data Importing
The dataset was imported into **Power BI Desktop** using the Excel workbook named `country_vaccinations.xlsx`.

### 🔹 Data Cleaning
- Missing values were replaced with `0` using Power BI’s **Transform Data** option.
- Ensured consistency and accuracy across 86,512 rows and 15 columns.

### 🔹 Data Interpretation
- Reviewed, categorized, and summarized key metrics using Power Query and visualization techniques.

### 🔹 Data Visualization
Created interactive visual dashboards using:
- Bar graphs
- Cards
- Slicers
- Maps
- Filters and color themes for better insights

## 📊 Analysis & Insights

- **Year-wise Vaccination Completion**:
  - 2020: 0.21% fully vaccinated
  - 2021: 79.08% fully vaccinated
  - 2022: 20.72% fully vaccinated

- **Key Metrics**:
  - Highest total daily vaccinations: **9.22 billion** in 2021
  - Highest daily vaccinations by country: **3.25 billion** in **China**

- **Top 10 Rankings**:
  - Fully Vaccinated Countries → *India* tops the list
  - Daily Vaccination → *China* leads
  - Overall Vaccinated People → *India* is the highest

## 📍 Recommendations
- Regularly update vaccination reports to enhance accuracy
- Allocate more resources and doses to countries with lower vaccination rates
- Consider extending the analysis to **regional or city-level granularity**

## ✅ Conclusion
This analysis reveals that the global vaccination effort progressed effectively. High vaccination rates in countries like India and China indicate strong public response, and suggest that the pandemic could be controlled more rapidly with continued efforts.

## 📦 Tools Used
